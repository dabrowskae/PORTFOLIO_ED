## ***ABOUT ME***
My name is Ewa Dabrowska. I am an administration employee. I would like to start my career as a **Q**uality **A**ssurance. I would like to have the possibility of development and self-realization. I started learning JavaScript on my own, but I do it in my free time and I know that it will take me a lot of time, but I also know that it is useful knowledge in the field of QA. 
Interests and Hobbies: I was educated and interested criminology and forensic techniques. I have completed two courses in penal sciences. I love reading detective stories and industry books and listening to true crime podcasts.
